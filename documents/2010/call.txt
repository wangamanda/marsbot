  JŸrgen Dix (Clausthal University of Technology)
  Jomi HŸbner (Federal University of Santa Catarina)

1. Aims and Scope

This competition is an attempt to stimulate research in the area
of multi-agent system development and programming by
1. identifying key problems,
2. collecting suitable benchmarks, and 
3. gathering test cases which require and enforce coordinated action
that can serve as milestones for testing multi-agent programming
languages, platforms and tools.



2. Short Scenario Description

The contest scenario consists of developing a multi-agent system to 
solve a cooperative task in a dynamic environment. The environment 
is a grid-like world in which virtual cows are moving around 
collectively in one or more herds exhibiting a swarm-like behavior. 
There are two corrals, each belongs to one of the two agent teams. 
The teams of agents compete to control the behavior of animals and 
lead them to their own corral. The winning agent team is the one 
that scores highest. A detailed scenario description of the scenario 
will be available in time.  



3. Participation Requirements

The participation in this contest consists of these parts:

1. Declaring the intent to participate by registering to
the mailing list.

2. Submission of the description of analysis, design and
implementation of a multi-agent system for the above application.
Thus registering to the contest officially.

3. Participation in the contest tournament by taking part on the 
final tournament.

4. Submitting the source-code of your application right after 
the tournament.

4. Details

4.1 Intention to Participate

Please announce your intention to attend the contest by
subscribing to the mailing list. Participants and all interested 
colleagues are invited to subscribe to the mailing list 
     agentcontest2010 [at] in.tu-clausthal.de

All the important details and announcements including scenario and communication
protocol specifications as well as software release announcements and
bug reports will be announced and discussed via this list.

To subscribe, send an e-mail to 
          agentcontest2010-subscribe [at] in.tu-clausthal.de 
with the subject "subscribe". The confirmation request
and welcome message will be sent to you shortly afterwards. Please
follow the instructions in the automatic mailing list replies.


4.2 Packages

The packages that we will publish include: 1. the protocol description
that defines the communication scheme between agents and our server, 2.
the scenario description that defines the environment, 3. the MASSim server, 
4. the scenario itself, 5. template-agents implemented in Java, and 6. an EIS.


4.3 Submissions of the Short Descriptions

We intend to handle the submissions of the short system-descriptions via EasyChair. 
We also aim at publishing in the CLIMA (@ECAI) post-proceedings (still in a planning
phase). We will provide details in time.


4.4 Scenario

The scenario will be *almost the same* as in 2010. The only thing that we are
going to adapt is the scoring schema (more details later). But if we 
discover further adaptations that would make the scenario more interesting
from a research-point-of-view, we could adapt as well.

4.5 Source Codes Obligation

Note that the submission of the source-codes is obligatory in 2010.
