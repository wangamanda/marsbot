===============================================================

* Aims and Scope:

This competition is an attempt to stimulate research in the area
of multi-agent system development and programming by
  1- identifying key problems and
  2- collecting suitable benchmarks
that can serve as milestones for testing multi-agent programming
languages, platforms and tools.


* Short scenario description:

It consists of applying (or developing from scratch) a multi-agent
system to solve a cooperative task in a highly dynamic environment.
The environment of the multi-agent system is a grid-like world in
which animals (e.g., cows) are moving around collectively in one or
more groups showing swarm like behaviour. There are two corrals
each belongs to one of the agent teams. The teams of agents compete
to control the behavior of animals and lead them to their own
corral. The winning agent team is the one that has a higher
number of cows collected in its corral. The scenario description
of the scenario will be available soon on the contest webpage.  


* Participation requirements:

The participation in this contest consists of two parts:
1- Submission of the description of analysis, design and
implementation of a multi-agent system for the above application.
The maximum length is 5 pages according to the LNCS format.
2- Participation in the contest tournament by means of an
(executable) implementation of a multi-agent system.
Further technical details on how to participate in this contest
can be found on the contest webpage
