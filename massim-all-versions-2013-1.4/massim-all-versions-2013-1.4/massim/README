1. MAVEN

The MASSim-project strongly supports Apache's build-tool Maven. Since the beginning of the project
we had been using Apache's Ant, but later found out that Maven is more comfortable, more elegant,
and easier to use.

Learn more about Maven here:
  http://maven.apache.org/

Maven is installed easily on MacOSX, Windows, and Linux. 

To compile the massim-artifact and generate a jar file run:
  mvn package

To generate a jar that contains all dependencies (encouraged to do so) run:
  mvn assembly:assembly

To quickly create a fully functional eclipse-project, that you can import into your workspace run:
  mvn eclipse:eclipse

2. DUMMY-AGENTS

A good starting point for connecting to the MASSim-server would be the
package massim.agent.
