 * This class serves as a good starting point for simulation observers. It is
 * strongly recommended to extend this class in order to write new observers, by
 * overriding some of the marked methods.
 * 
 * Observers in general are classes that are neither supposed to change a
 * simulation in any way. The only thing that they might change is the timing of
 * a simulation. They do only have read-only access.
