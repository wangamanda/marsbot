/**
 * This class provides some reasonable defaults for relatively simple simulations and allows the reuse of classes written
 * for such simulations. In contrast to DefaultSimulation there are som import paradigm shifts.
 * 
 * There is now an array of agent states. Each agent state contains all agent specific state information. This might be the
 * agents condition, position or score. Additionally there is one world state. It contains all information about the world meaning everything
 * that is not directly associated with one agent. These two states describe the whole state of the simulation implementation specific
 * side.
 * 
 * Please note that those states are also exported via massim.Simulation.getSimulationState(). So they are supposed to be "clean", i.e.
 * not containing any helper structures that are just there to ease access to data inside the state, like hashtables or something similar.
